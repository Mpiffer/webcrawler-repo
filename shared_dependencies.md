1. **Python Libraries**: The Python files `main.py` and `reddit_scraper.py` will share the Scrapy library for web scraping.

2. **Data Schema**: The `data.json` file will store the scraped data from Reddit. The schema of this data will be shared between the `reddit_scraper.py` (which writes the data) and `main.py` (which may read or manipulate the data).

3. **CSS Styles**: The `styles.css` and `tailwind.css` files will share CSS classes and IDs that are used in `index.html` for styling the website.

4. **HTML Elements**: The `index.html` file will contain HTML elements with specific IDs that are manipulated by the `main.js` JavaScript file. These IDs are shared dependencies.

5. **Assets**: The `logo.png` and `background.png` files in the assets directory are shared dependencies as they are used in the `index.html` file for the website's design.

6. **JavaScript Functions**: The `main.js` file will contain JavaScript functions that manipulate the DOM elements in `index.html`. The names of these functions are shared dependencies.

7. **CSS Framework**: The `tailwind.css` file is a shared dependency as it provides the Tailwind CSS framework used for styling in `index.html` and `styles.css`.

8. **Website Content**: The content displayed on the website (in `index.html`) is a shared dependency as it may be influenced by the data scraped by `reddit_scraper.py` and stored in `data.json`.
